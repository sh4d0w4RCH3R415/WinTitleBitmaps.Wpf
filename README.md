# WinTitleBitmaps.Wpf -  Click [here](https://github.com/sh4d0w4RCH3R415/WinTitleBitmaps/) to go to the original library.
## Description
A WPF-framework version of the original project "WinTitleBitmaps". I have copy/pasted the code from the WinForms-framework version and changed some lines to make this library compatible with WPF.<br/><br/>
Do note: ***This library works ONLY with WPF and NOT WinForms***.
